HillCipher
==========

HillCipher Encryption program created for a friend at UCF. 

See example text files for how to set up both the key and the message text files.

Key text file layout: The first line is the number of rows and columns
The following lines are the matrix key for the hill cipher.

The message file contains the message. In any format you would like please see the example provided in the example_files directory.

The src program contains 2 executable programs. MainForm whcih is a GUI for the HillCipher and SampleProgramRun which is the console version which I believe was created as for program requirement. The GUI was something I did before I knew the full requirements.
